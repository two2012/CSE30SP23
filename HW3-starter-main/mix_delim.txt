In fields of green, the flowers   sway.
Their 	petals so soft, a sweet ballet.
Beneath the sun,  	they bloom	so gay.
Their 	beauty is bright, in full display.
The trees stand tall, their 	leaves unfurled.
A canopy, to 	shade the whole world.
The birds take     flight,  their leaves unfurled,
Their songs so  sweet, a joyful swirl.
