THE NATIONAL PARKS

Does the world look like a park to you? Yes, almost suddenly
The world looks like a park.
Are there worn spots in the shorn grass? Yes, under
The childrenâ€™s feet,
And under the feet of bison behind trees.

Are there temperature-controls in the park? Yes, the warm sun
Is made shady, and the warm shade
Sunny. Feelings too,
Whether out on the shorn lawns or behind the bushes,
Run hot and cold, to the edges of Africa and Chicago.

It is a national park, then? Yes, national
In its red, white, and blue bunting, in its scope and convenience.
Hear the bears groping for sliced bacon.
In the national parks, however, the turbulence
Still perseveres, of waters? Glaciers and gorges

Move down as ever onto the warm lawns?
Yes, but just to the point where the dams take them. Then they
    ripple
Over the flooded farms of the Havasupai,
Nepbhertiti and Osiris,
Carrying them softly off to the museums.
